# Emacs

[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor.

## Spacemacs

[Spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/README.md)is a new way to experience Emacs -- a sophisticated and polished set-up focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency.

### Installation

1. IfyouhaveanexistingEmacsconfiguration,backitupfirst:

   ```
   cd ~
   mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
   mv .emacs .emacs.bak
   ```

   Don't forget to backup and_remove_`~/.emacs`file otherwise Spacemacs  
   **WILLNOT**load since that file prevents Emacs from loading the proper  
   initialization file.

2. Clonetherepository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
   ```

   `master`is the stable branch and it is_immutable_,**DONOT**make any  
   modification to it or you will break the update mechanism. If you want to  
   fork Spacemacs safely use the`develop`branch where you handle the update  
   manually.

3. \(Optional\) Install the[Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)font.

   If you are running in terminal you'll also need to change font settings of  
   your terminal.

4. Launch Emacs. Spacemacs will automatically install the packages it requires.  
   If you get an error regarding package downloads then you may try to disable  
   the HTTPS protocol by starting Emacs with

   ```
   emacs --insecure
   ```

   Or you can set the`dotspacemacs-elpa-https`to`nil`in your dotfile to  
   remove the need to start Emacs with`--insecure`argument. You may wish to  
   clear out your`.emacs.d/elpa`directory before doing this, so that any  
   corrupted packages you may have downloaded will be re-installed.

5. RestartEmacstocompletetheinstallation.

## Purcell'sEmacsconfiguration

This is[Purcell's](https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d)emacs configuration tree, continually used and tweaked since 2000, and it may be a good starting point for other Emacs users, especially those who are web developers. These days it's somewhat geared towards macOS, but it is known to also work on Linux and Windows.

### Installation

To install, clone this repository to`~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the`init.el`contained in this repository ends up at`~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly running`M-x package-refresh-contents`before doing so.

## DoomEmacs

[Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs)is a configuration for GNU Emacs written by a stubborn, shell-dwelling, and melodramatic ex-vimmer. It wasn't originally intended for public use, but can be considered a hacker's starter kit.

### Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
cp init.example.el init.el  # maybe edit init.el
make install
```

Don't forget to run`make`every time you modify`init.el`!
