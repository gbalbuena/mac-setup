# LaTeX

## Installing LaTeX on Mac

When installing LaTex, two following options are given to users.
  1. Install MacTeX with builtin editor(TexLive) - (2GB)
  2. Install BasicTeX only (100MB) + your personal LaTeX editor

### Option 1 (Full LaTeX installation with LaTeX editor):

Download [MacTex](http://www.tug.org/mactex/).
For more details about MaxTex: [Click Here](https://www.tug.org/mactex/What_Is_Installed.pdf).

Since MaxTex installs an LaTex editor ([TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/download.html)) already, installing another LaTeX editor is unnecessary.

### Option 2 (BasicTeX + Custom LaTeX editor):

Download [BasicTeX](http://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html).
For more details about BasicTex: [Click Here](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/BasicTeX.pdf).

Pick one of the following LaTeX editors:
LaTex Editor's:
  1. [TexMaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)
  2. [TeXstudio](http://texstudio.sourceforge.net/)
  3. [TeXworks](https://github.com/TeXworks/texworks/releases)
  4. [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/)
  5. [LyX](http://www.lyx.org/)
  6. [TeXlipse](http://texlipse.sourceforge.net/)
  7. [Sublime Text 3 - LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools)

### MacTeX vs BasicTeX

MacTeX includes additional programs such as an editor and a BibTeX reference manager that help users to work with TeX outside of the command line. BasicTeX does not include these GUI programs. The trade-off that comes with using BasicTeX is that you will have to download and install additional packages and programs as the need arises- and BasicTeX is so basic that the need will arise. So, after installing BasicTeX you will be faced with the tasks of installing additional programs and installing missing packages.
